        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>As a Full Stack Web Developer, I’ve developed a strong understanding of both front-end and back-end technologies through hands-on experience and continuous learning. I’ve worked with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Node.js, and Python to build responsive, user-centered applications. On the front end, I focus on creating clean, accessible interfaces, while on the back end, I ensure data is handled securely and efficiently. I’ve also become familiar with RESTful APIs and integrating services to connect user interactions with backend logic. My approach to development involves problem solving, analyzing requirements, and breaking tasks into manageable components to ensure functionality and scalability.</p>
